# Guess-a-Number
This program generates a random integer between 1-100 and allows the user to guess. If the user inputs a decimal or string it will tell the user to only input whole numbers and will allow them to guess again. The program tells you if your guess is too high or too low and will display the total number of guesses when you guess correctly.
